**Indian Sign Language (ISL) Translation Using KNN**
_Project Overview_

This project aims to translate Indian Sign Language (ISL) gestures into text using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. It allows hearing individuals to understand sign language gestures and helps in bridging the communication gap between the deaf and hearing communities.

_Features_

- Recognizes ISL hand gestures from images.
- Translates gestures into corresponding text.
- Uses KNN algorithm for classification.
- Easy to expand for more gestures.

Methodology

1 Data Preprocessing

- Resize images to a uniform size.
- Convert images to grayscale or flatten them into feature vectors.

2 Normalize pixel values for better KNN performance.

- KNN Algorithm
- KNN classifies gestures based on distance metrics (Euclidean distance) between feature vectors.
- The gesture is predicted based on the majority vote among K nearest neighbors.

3 Model Training and Testing

- Fit the KNN model on the training dataset.
- Test the model using the testing dataset and calculate accuracy.
